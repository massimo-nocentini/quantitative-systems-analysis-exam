      This short article collects the work I did in order to support
      my Quantitative Systems Analysis exam. The goal is to study
      resources usage respect a collection of user profiles, each of
      them catch a way of using some applications of interest in
      different time windows. I performed some experiments collecting
      results in a OLAP ``star''-like relational schema in order to
      provide summaries for dimensions under study, such as bandwidth
      usage, network activity, CPU and memory consumption.

    \section{Introduction}

    This homework aims to study resources usage respect a collection
    of user profiles; we're mainly interested on network activities,
    but we pair it with CPU and memory consumption. In order to
    complete this work we take it apart, discussing the activity plan,
    the instrumentation of the system used by different profiles, the
    plan of experiments and finally data management and analysis of
    results in the following sections. In the 
 
    \section{Activity Plan}
    In this section I tackle the problem at hand describing the
    methodology used to perform the requested analysis, breaking the
    problem statement down in its major components. In the next
    section I'll describe them informally, leaving a precise
    description of their actions in \autoref{sec:plan-of-experiment}.


    \subsection{User profiles}
    A central concept is that of \emph{user profile} which abstract
    the behavior of a person using a computer. In this homework I've
    considered two user profiles: a \emph{landlady} and a
    \emph{computer scientist}. Informally, a landlady will use the
    computer for simple tasks such as checking emails, surfing the web
    and watch some YouTube videos; on the other hand a computer
    scientist will use the computer for writing Tex documents,
    programming (in Smalltalk especially), collaborate with colleagues
    via instant messaging and checking its email account.

    \subsection{Different workloads at different hours}
    In order to study the user profiles I arranged that each one of
    them performs their actions repeating the same sequence of steps
    (with some minor variants) in three different time windows, namely
    in the morning, in the afternoon and in the evening. This allow us
    to characterize the same activity in different time windows with
    different workloads, in order to compare them in a quite real
    scenario.

    For example the \emph{landlady} user profile will do a quick check
    of emails in the morning, writing short messages to her friends in
    the afternoon while in the evening she replies to important mails
    with more care, preparing two or more draft of her reply.

    On the other side, the \emph{computer scientist} prepare a first
    implementation of an algorithm in the morning, carefully stress it
    with a test suite in the afternoon while in the evening he re-factor
    it to perform better.

    It is important to observe that each activity isn't performed in
    solitude, that is both email checking and programming could happen
    concurrently with other actions, for example searching some
    information on the web. This allow us to reify a scenario that is
    close to a real context, with the drawback of losing repetition
    among experiment execution.

    \subsection{Quantities to assess}
    We are interested on the resource consumption for each user
    profile during the three time windows as explained in the previous
    section. In particular we identifies the following quantities to
    be relevant for our analysis:
    \begin{description}
    \item[memory] the amount of free, buffered and cached memory;
    \item[disk IO] the blocks received from and sent to a block
      device;
    \item[CPU] the time spent running non-kernel code, kernel code and
      idle cycles;
    \item[network traffic] incoming and outgoing packets through a
      network interface, in particular we perform a complete packet
      sniffing in order to aggregate results as explained in
      \autoref{sec:data-management-result-analysis}.
    \end{description}


    \subsection{Factors and experiment conditioning}
    Since we would like to perform a monitoring of actions that
    actually happened, we fix as ``held-constant factors'' the use of
    applications as defined in \autoref{sec:plan-of-experiment}, while
    as ``allowed-to-vary factors'' every little deviations and
    ``micro'' actions from the main line experiment description. 

    This implies that experiment definition be described proposing an
    ``average'' behavior, allowing us to study the ``confirmation'' of
    measured quantities respect the same activity; the ``discovery''
    of patterns under slightly different operational conditions and
    ``stability'' of collected measure.

    \section{Measuring system instrumentation}
    To collect data about quantities of interest we've instrumented a
    laptop (from now we call it the ``instrumented system'' or just
    ``system'') used by the two user profiles. Since our study is a
    kind of monitoring, we need to setup neither hardware/software
    probes nor failure injectors.

    The system have a 64bit Intel architecture, equipped with 8 GB of
    RAM powered by Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS distribution. Two different
    tools had been used to collect quantities:

    \subsection{vmstat} 
    To measure memory and CPU usage, we've used the command line tool
    \emph{vmstat} \cite{vmstat}. This tool is very lightweight and
    print a summary line with a super set of the information we
    need. In particular the command we've used is the following:
\begin{verbatim}
vmstat 15 -n -S M > computer-scientist-morning-day-<n>.log
\end{verbatim}
    just a few explanations: every $15$ seconds prints a summary line,
    ``-n'' doesn't repeat an header line periodically, ``-S M'' use
    Megabytes as measure unit for memory quantities, ``$> ...$''
    redirecting to a file in order to post process data;

    \subsection{SNORT} 
    To measure network traffic we've used the \emph{SNORT} tool
    \cite{SNORT}, as required by homework assignment. We've made a
    first attempt to write some custom rule in order to filter some
    messaging, but since the experiments we wish to perform aren't so
    complicated, we've chosen a complete sniffing approach, in order
    to save everything in a binary file ready for a later processing
    using the ``read'' feature provided by \emph{SNORT} itself. So,
    according the manual \cite{SNORT-manual}, we sniffed packages with
    the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
sudo snort -l snort-logs/ -b
\end{verbatim}


    \section{Plan of experiments}
    \label{sec:plan-of-experiment}
    In this section we plan the experiments to gain insight about
    resource usage by different user profiles, describing experiments
    for each profile in a dedicated subsection.

    \subsection{Landlady experiments plan}

    \begin{description}
    \item[experiment one] In the morning, the landlady open Mozilla
      Firefox browser, log in into her \emph{GMail} account, checks for
      new mail and log out after reading new messages, under the
      assumption that she reads at least two messages.
    \item[experiment two] In the afternoon, the landlady open Mozilla
      Firefox browser, log in into her \emph{GMail} account, checks for
      new mail and writes three short greetings to her friends. Here
      by ``short greetings'' we means a message with at most 50 words.
      While writing greetings, she watches her favorite YouTube video
      which has duration about two minutes at the best resolution
      available.
    \item[experiment three] In the evening, the landlady open Mozilla
      Firefox browser, log in into her \emph{GMail} account, checks for
      new mail and prepare two draft for an important reply (assuming
      that at least one message received during the day deserve
      careful response). After saving the two draft, it randomly
      select one of those and send it. Here by ``important reply'' we
      mean a message with at least 120 words.
    \end{description}

    \subsection{Computer scientist experiments plan}
    \begin{description}
    \item[experiment one] In the early morning, the computer scientist
      writes a draft of at least 400 words using the Emacs text
      editor, compiles it using \TeX three times. Then he upload a
      backup copy on its Google Drive space using Mozilla Firefox
      browser. Finally he writes one message to his advisor with the
      compiled draft as attachment from his GMail web mail interface.
    \item[experiment two] In the late morning, the computer scientist
      do some hacking on his Pharo Smalltalk system, executing an
      intensive fluid dynamics analysis for a gas network. This
      analysis is repeated three times, each of one is 20 seconds
      longer. Waiting for analysis results, he talks with his
      colleague using Google Hangout directly from his GMail web mail
      interface, sending and receiving at least 10 short phrases. Here
      by ``short phrase'' we mean a message with at most 10 words.
    \item[experiment three] In the afternoon, the computer scientist
      discuss the fluid analysis result obtained in the morning in a
      joint work through a video call using Google Hangout. The call
      has duration about one minute, during which he keeps the Pharo
      Smalltalk image running but he do not apply changes.
    \item[experiment four] In the evening, the computer scientist
      reviews the draft written in the early morning, using the Emacs
      text editor to skim through it and applies a spell checker. He
      at least recompile the document two times and after that he
      dispatch three mails from his Google web mail interface to his
      close friends. We assume that such minor modifications do not
      change the compiled file dimension.
    \end{description}

    \subsection{FSF supporter experiment plan}
    \begin{description}
    \item[experiment one] In the afternoon, the FSF supporter opens
      the Bit Torrent Transmission client application in order to
      supply three ISO images, namely Ubuntu, Xubuntu and Kubuntu
      Linux distributions. He set an upload limit at 20 KB/s and keeps
      Transmission running for about two minutes.
    \item[experiment two] In the evening, the FSF supporter opens the
      Bit Torrent Transmission client application in order to supply
      three ISO images, namely Ubuntu, Xubuntu and Kubuntu Linux
      distributions. He set an upload limit at 60 KB/s and keeps
      Transmission running for about two minutes.
    \end{description}
